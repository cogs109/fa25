Hi everyone! My name is Parinita, but you can call me Pari. I’m a fourth-year Cognitive Science student specializing in Neuroscience. I’m excited to be a **PLA** for COGS 109 this quarter, since I believe learning how to analyze and interpret data is essential across many fields. I hope to continue building my skills as I explore data science further in graduate school. Outside of academics, I love traveling and dancing. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat. I’m looking forward to working with you this quarter!

**Weekly OH:** During discussion section on X and X.
