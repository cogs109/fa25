Hello everyone, my name is Johny and I will be one of your **PLAs** for this quarter. I'm a fourth-year Cognitive Science student specializing in Machine Learning. I am looking forward to working with you all with different approaches to modeling and data analysis. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and playing video games. If you have any questions about anything regarding this course or anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out!

**Weekly OH:** During discussion section on X and X.
