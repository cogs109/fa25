Hello there, my name is Jiesen but you may also call me Jason. I'm a 1st year [MSCS](https://cse.ucsd.edu/graduate/degree-programs/ms-program) student and a HDSI alumni. Very excited to be the TA of COGS 109 and look forward to discussing with you about the different ways to model and understand data. In addition, I am also very into film and music, especially Asian and European ones. Feel free to reach out to me to discuss these or academic related topics!
