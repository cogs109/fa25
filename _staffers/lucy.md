Hi everyone, I'm excited to be your instructor for COGS 109! I fell in love with teaching in college, and since then, have taught over 10 different undergraduate and graduate courses and developed 3 of my own. I received my Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Harvard in May 2024, where I studied "resource-rational" decision making, or how people make decisions with limited cognitive resources. My research uses computational modeling (including information theory, Bayesian statistics, and reinforcement learning) to understand human behavior and cognition.
