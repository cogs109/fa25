Hi everyone, I'm a new faculty member at UCSD and excited to be teaching COGS 109 this quarter! In this course, we’ll explore different ways to model and understand data, while building practical skills that are useful for research, industry, and beyond. You’re always welcome to come to my office hours to ask questions or just say hello. I’m looking forward to a great quarter together!
